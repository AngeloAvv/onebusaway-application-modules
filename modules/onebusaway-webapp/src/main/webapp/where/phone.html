<h4>How can I get arrival info for just a single route?</h4>

route.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Wait until arrival information is being read for a specific stop (see Quick Start for more details).</li>
    <li>Press <b>1</b>.</li>
    <li>Enter your route number, followed by the # sign.</li>
    <li>Listen as specific arrival information for that route is listed.</li>
    <li>To go back to the full listing of all routes, press *.</li>
</ol>

<a name="bookmark_a_stop"></a>
<h4>How can I bookmark a stop?</h4>

<p>It can be annoying to have to remember the stop numbers that you frequently use. Fortunately, you can bookmark
your frequent stops for quick access.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Wait until arrival information is being read for a specific stop (see Quick Start for more details).</li>
    <li>Press <b>2</b>.</li>

</ol>

access each bookmark by pressing <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, etc for the number corresponding to each bookmark.</p>

<a name="search_for_a_stop"></a>
<h4>How can I search for stop?</h4>

<p>If the stop number is missing from the <a href="stopNumber.html">posted schedule</a>, you can search for stops by
route number.</p>

<ol>
    <li>From the main menu, press <b>6</b>.</li>
    <li>Enter your route number, followed by the # sign.</li>
    <li>Select the final destination of the route from the list.</li>

    stop.</li>
</ol>

<a name="most_recent_stop"></a>

next call, simply enter <b>5</b> at the main menu.</p>
