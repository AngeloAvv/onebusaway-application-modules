<h3>Making OneBusAway Better</h3>

<p>OneBusAway is open-source software, which makes it easy for the community to develop and add new features.
Check out our <a href="http://code.google.com/p/onebusaway">Google code page</a> or read <a href="http://code.google.com/p/onebusaway/wiki/HackingOneBusAway">our guide</a> to hacking OneBusAway.</p>

<h3>About Us</h3>

<p>This site was originally put together by <a href="mailto:bdferris@onebusaway.org">Brian Ferris</a>, a grad
student in <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/">Computer Science &amp; Engineering</a> at the <a
    href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/bdferris/">University of Washington</a>. Brian developed this site
    after too many late nights in the rain, wondering if the 44 would ever come.</p>

<p>Brian's partner-in-crime is <a href="mailto:kariwat@onebusaway.org">Kari Watkins</a>, a <a href="http://www.ce.washington.edu/">Civil Engineering</a>
grad student also at UW. Kari does research on understanding why people do and don't take transit with the goal of
getting more people to switch to a friendlier mode. You can typically find her riding any number of buses in North
Seattle (65, 75, 30, 74, 71) with a little girl on each arm.</p>

<p>OneBusAway also supports research at the University of Washington.  Check out our <a href="research/index.html">research page</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Thanks to Nokia Research and the National Science Foundation under Grant IIS-0705898 for financially helping to support this project!</p>

<p>Thanks also to all our other supporters. Specifically, thanks to our advisors at UW for being supportive of OneBusAway: Alan Borning, Dieter Fox, Scott
Rutherford, and Paul Waddell. Thanks to all our friends at UW and beyond who have used OneBusAway and
given us feedback. Thanks to Adam and Evan for their feedback on this site in the early days and their general interest
in transit hacking.</p>

<p>Are you interested in hacking tools to make mass transit a little less painful? We've got some crazy ideas but
only so many hours in the day. Drop us an <a href="mailto:contact@onebusaway.org">email</a> if you'd like to join
forces.</p>
