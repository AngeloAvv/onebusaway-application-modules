<h2>Text-Messaging Interface</h2>

<p><i>You can get real-time arrival info over SMS. Just text your stop number in and get real-time bus arrival
info back on your phone.</i></p>

<h3>Quick Start</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Find your <a href="stopNumber.html">stop number</a></li>
    <li>Text "<span class="sms">onebus stop_number_here</span>" to <span class="sms">41411</span>.</li>
    <li>Wait for arrival information to be texted back to your phone.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a quick example, to get real-time arrival info for stop# 75414, text "<span class="sms">onebus 75414</span>" to 41411.</p>

<h3>Your Default Search Location</h3>

<p>When you use the SMS system for the first time, we will ask you to enter your zip-code so that we can provide
results relevant to your area among the <a href="standard/agencies.action">multiple transit agencies</a> supported
by OneBusAway</p>

<p>If you need to change your default search location, see the <a href="#default_search_location">instructions below</a>.</p>

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

<h4>How can I get arrival info for just a single route?</h4>

<p>For busy stops, you may wish to view arrival information for just one or two routes. To specify a route, text "<span class="sms">onebus
stop# route#</span>".</p>

<p>For example, stop # 578 at 3rd and Pike is served by 21 different routes. To see just arrivals for routes 16 and
26, you can text "<span class="sms">onebus 578 16,26</span>" to 41411 to get real-time arrival info for just those routes.</p>

<h4>How can I change my default search location?</h4>

<p>When you use the SMS system for the first time, we will ask you to enter your zip-code so that we can provide
results relevant to your area among the <a href="standard/agencies.action">multiple transit agencies</a> supported
by OneBusAway.  You can change your default search location using the following steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Text "<span class="sms">onebus #setSearchLocation</span>" to 41411.</li>
    <li>You'll get an SMS back asking you to enter you zip code.</li>
    <li>Text back your zip-code for your location.</li>
    <li>You'll receive a confirmation text noting that your default search location has been updated.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="section">
<a name="bookmarks"></a>
<h4>How can I bookmark stops for easier access?</h4>

<p>You can bookmark stops through the SMS interface for quicker access.</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="label">Add a bookmark:</span> Text "<span class="sms">onebus #bookmarks add</span>" will create a bookmark for your most recently access stop.</li>
<li><span class="label">List your bookmarks:</span> Text "<span class="sms">onebus #bookmarks</span>" to show your set of bookmarks.</li>
<li><span class="label">Access a bookmark:</span> Text "<span class="sms">onebus #bookmarks X</span>" where X is the bookmark index.</li>
<li><span class="label">Delete a bookmark:</span> Text "<span class="sms">onebus #bookmarks delete X</span>" where X is the bookmark index.</li>
</ul>

<p>Special tip: you don't actually have to type out all of #bookmarks.  #book and even #boo will work.</p>
