<h4>Download the OneBusAway app in the Android Marketplace on your phone</h4>

<p>We're proud to announce that OneBusAway now has an official Android client. SeattleBusBot, a native Android client for OneBusAway, is becoming the official Android client for OneBusAway. You can find the app by searching for "OneBusAway" in the Android Marketplace.</p>

<p>SeattleBusBot was written by local Seattle developer <a href="http://www.joulespersecond.com/#Main">Paul Watts</a>. The app combines a lot of the same features found in the OneBusAway native iPhone app, but has some new bells and whistles too, such as bus arrival alarms and route bookmarking. And just like OneBusAway, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/seattle-bus-bot/">the app is open source too</a>.</p>

<p>What do these changes mean? Paul will still be the lead developer on the Android app, but he'll be rebranding it as OneBusAway over the next few weeks. I'll be doing more to publicize the app to OneBusAway users with Android phones. Finally, we're hoping that by combing our resources, we can do an even better job of providing King County riders with great tools that make it easier to use public transit.</p>
