    <p>Love the real-time bus arrival information provided by <a href="http://mybus.org/">MyBus</a> for
      <a href="http://transit.metrokc.gov/">King County Metro</a> transit routes?  We certainly do.  We also think 
      it can be an even better tool with a few improvements.  We aim to provide the following:</p>
 
     <ul class="benefits">
       <li>Arrival info for every bus stop, not just a few timepoints.</li>
       <li>A <a href="where/phone/index.html">telephone number</a> you can call to quickly get real-time arrival info when you're waiting at your stop.</li>
       <li>An updated <a href="where/standard/index.html">website</a> that makes it easier to find arrival info when you're waiting at home.</li>
       <li>Enhanced mobile tools for <a href="where/iphone/index.action">iPhones</a> and <a href="where/text/index.action">other mobile devices</a>.</li>
     </ul>
     
     <p>Why?  We're Metro KC riders just like you and we don't like waiting for the bus any more than we have to.</p>
