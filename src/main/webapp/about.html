		<h2>About</h2>
		
		<p>This site was put together by <a href="mailto:bdferris@gmail.com">Brian Ferris</a>, a grad student 
		at the <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/bdferris/">University of Washington</a>.  Brian
		is a regular rider of the 65, but developed this site after too many late nights in the rain, wondering
		if the 44 would ever come.</p>
		
		<p>Thanks for Adam and Evan for their feedback on this site and their general interest in transit hacking.
		Are you interested in hacking tools to make mass transit a little less painful?  I've got some crazy ideas
		but only so many hours in the day.  Drop me an <a href="mailto:bdferris@gmail.com">email</a> if you'd like
		to join forces.</p>
