<h2>Text-Messaging Interface</h2>

<p><i>You can get real-time arrival info over SMS. Just text your stop number in and get real-time bus arrival
info back on your phone.</i></p>

<h3>Quick Start</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Find your <a href="stopNumber.html">stop number</a>.</li>
    <li>Text "<b>onebus stop_number_here</b>" to <b>41411</b>.</li>
    <li>Wait for arrival information to be texted back to your phone.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

<p>As a quick example, to get real-time arrival info for stop# 75414, text "<b>onebus 75414</b>" to 41411.</p>

<p>For busy stops, you may wish to view arrival information for just one or two routes. To specify a route, text "<b>onebus
stop# route#</b>".</p>

<p>For example, stop # 578 at 3rd and Pike is served by 21 different routes. To see just arrivals for routes 16 and
26, you can text "<b>onebus 578 16,26</b>" to 41411 to get real-time arrival info for just those routes.</p>
