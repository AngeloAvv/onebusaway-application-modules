    <h2>Stop Number</h2>
    
    <p>How do you know your stop number?  It's a little tricky, but if your stop has a posted schedule, then it
    should have the stop number.</p>
    
    <p>There is a series of three numbers, separated by dashes, in the upper-left
    corner of the schedule.  The middle number is the stop number.  The image below shows you were to look.</p>
    
    <p class="stopIdentificationImages">
      <img id="stopIdImage01" title="Metro KC Stop Number Identification" src="StopIdentification01.jpg" /> <img id="stopIdImage02" title="Metro KC Stop Number Identification" src="StopIdentification02.jpg" />
      <div class="clear"> </div>
    </p>
    
    <p>If your stop has a shelter, the stop number is also painted in the upper-left corner.</p>
    
    <h3>What if the schedule is missing?</h3>
    
    <p>All too frequently, the posted schedule is missing or the stop number is covered.  What to do?</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>The <a href="phone.html">phone</a> interface and <a href="iphone/">iPhone interface</a> both have tools for looking up stops by route number.</li>
        <li>You can also use the <a href="standard/">website</a> to lookup stop numbers.  Not really convenient if you are already standing at the stop.</li>
