    <p>Where is your bus?  You never want to know more than when you are standing at the stop waiting, but if
    you aren't lucky enough to have an internet-enabled cellphone, there is hope.</p>
    
    <h2 class="phone_number">206-456-0609</h2>
    
    <p>Call the number listed above and you can get real-time arrival information for your stop. You can also:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Bookmark stops for quick access later</li>
      <li>Search for stops by route and location</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>How do you know your stop number?  It's a little tricky, but if your stop has a posted schedule, then it
    should have the stop number.  There is a series of three numbers, separated by dashes, in the upper-left
    corner of the schedule.  The middle number is the stop number.  The image below shows you were to look.</p>
